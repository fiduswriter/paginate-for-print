<h1>simplePagination.js</h1>
<p>This project aims to create an alternative to pagination.js, without making use of CSS Regions.</p>
<p>So far, two experiments with cutting up HTML to fit into individual pages can be tried out:</p>
<p><a href="overflow-cut.html">An overflow based cut up mechanism</a> and <a href="range-cut.html">range based cutting mechanism</a>.</p>
